# fortunately-not-frontend

Welcome to Fortunately Not. The Magic EightBall App. Here you can play a classic magic eightball, build your own eightball, or choose from a library of pre-made eightballs! 

To work the app you will need git clone both this repo as well as the backend located at https://github.com/bellaappel/fortunately-not-backend. Once both repos have been cloned. Start up a rails server and get playing! Enjoy and please let me know if you have any questions!
